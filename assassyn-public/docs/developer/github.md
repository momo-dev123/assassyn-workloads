## Rust Toolchain

**Tooling:** This project is written purely in Rust, which means you can easily use this
project as a library in other projects, or modularly invoke a unit test. It is highly recommended
to use nightly build Rust, as we use the `join` method to calculate the span to the generated
AST nodes, which is only available in nightly. Use the command below to set the nightly build:

````
rustup override set nightly
````

**Tests and Examples:** We use Rust's built-in test framework to write test cases for each module.
You can use `cargo test [test-name]` to invoke a specific test case. If debugging output logs are
desired, use `cargo test [test-name] -- --nocapture`.

A test case not only checks the correctness of a newly written module, but also serves as an
example to see how certain interfaces should be used. Moreover, it also offers a light-weighted
way to write a toy example to play with this framework, and sanity-check the build success.

## Git & Github Usage

**Formatting:** To ensure consistent code style, copy `assassyn/utils/pre-commit` to your
`.git/hooks/pre-commit`. This setup automatically formats your code and checks coding style with each commit.

If you want to bypass the pre-commit hook during a commit, you can use the command:

````
git commit -m 'your commit message' --no-verify
````

**Adding New Features:**

1. Fork the repository to your account <img src="./imag/fork.png" width=100>.
2. Clone your fork: `git clone <url-to-your-fork>`.
3. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b <your-dev-branch>`.
4. After development, submit a pull request to the master branch from your branch.
   - Go to the Pull Request tab in our repo <img src="./imag/pr-tab.png" width=75%>.
   - Find the `New Pull Request` button <img src="./imag/new-pr.png" width=75>
   - Select the base branch as `master` and compare branch as your development branch
     <img src="./imag/pr-base-dev.png" width="50%">
   - After filling out the PR title and description, click `Create Pull Request` <img src="./imag/create-pr.png" width=100>
   - Wait for all the checks done by the CI/CD pipeline, and the code review from the maintainers. <img src="./imag/pr-checks.png">
   - If everything is good, the maintainers will merge your PR.

**Resolve the conflicts:**

If there is a conflict, resolve it by rebasing the master branch to your development branch.

- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/synthesys-lab/assassyn`
- `git fetch upstream`
- `git rebase upstream/master # Follow the git instructions to resolve conflicts`
- `git push -f origin <your-dev-branch>`
